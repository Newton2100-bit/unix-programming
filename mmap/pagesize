page 
- is the smallest unit of memory that can have distinct permissions and behaviour
(it is the builing block of memory mappings,which in turn are the building blocks of the processes' adress space)

the [ mmap() ] operates on pages.
both the adrr and offste parameters must be aligned on a page sized boundary.

It is worth noting that
addr and offset must be multiples of pagesize( that is add must be the start of a page as well as offset must match the 
start of a page)
of len doesn't fit even full pages then the last page will be filled with zeros after the len
any write to the zero will not be reflected to the file even if MAP_SHARED was present.
<<< Only the original len bytes are ever written
back to the file.>>>
