void *mmap(void *addr, /* if provided it becomes the base of our mapping */
		size_t len, /* The number of bytes to map right after the offset. */
		int prot,/* Access permissions */
		int flags,/ * additional behaviour */
		int fd,/* this is the targrt objet to be mapped into memory */
		off_t offset);/* position to start mapping inside the target object */

- A call to mmap asks the kernel to map len bytes of the object represented by the file descriptor fd
starting at offset bytes into the file into memory
- If addr is included it indicates a preference to use that starting address in memory.
- prot describes the desired memory protection of the mapping (memory proection)
argments can be 
	PROT_NONE -> in which case the pages will be inaccesible which does not make any sense
	PROT_WRITE -> the pages may be read
	PROT_READ -> the pages may be read
	PROT_EXEC -> the pages may be executed
(The protection modes must not conflict with the open mode of the object{file})
flags
- It describes the type of mapping, and  some elements of it's behavior.
it can be an y of the bitie of the below
 	1. MAP_FIXEDa- treat addr as a requirement not a hint
		- if unable to map into addr then the map fails
		- if the address and the length address overlap with an existing mapping then then the
			 overlapped pages arediscarded and replAced by the new mapping.
		- it is non-portable and it's use is discouraged
		
		
	2. MAP_PRIVATE
		- states that the mapping is not shared
		- the file is maped copy on write and any changes made to the file by this process is not reflected
			to the actual file or in mappings of orther processes
	3. MAP_SHARED
		- shares the same mapping with all orther processes that map this same file.
		- writting into the mapping in memory by this process is equivalent to writting into the file 

- When you map a file the reference count is incremented so you can close the fd and still you will have 
a file at your disposal


/* Example usage */
void *p
p = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
if (p == MAP_FAILED)
	perror("mmap error");
